What Are the Easiest Loans to Get?

The easiest loans to get are those that require no credit check, such as those from loan apps and some online lenders. However, these loans tend to have high interest rates that will increase the total cost of the loan.

The minimum amount for a personal loan is generally around $1,000. You may find loans of lower amounts through lenders such as loan apps, payday loan providers, and cash advances on your credit card. However, these lenders tend to charge higher interest rates than you would find on a personal loan.
